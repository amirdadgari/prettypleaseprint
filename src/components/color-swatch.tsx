/**
 * A filament colour, drawn from a ticket's or a catalogue row's snapshot.
 *
 * `stripe` is the full-width band along the top of a card rather than a dot.
 * It is a prop and not a class the caller passes because the display mode is
 * the one thing this component has to own: it used to hard-code `inline-flex`
 * and take `block` through `className`, the two fought, and the band on every
 * card collapsed to the width of its content — nothing, or a clipped "?".
 *
 * `mark` draws the question mark on a "whatever" swatch. Callers turn it off
 * where the swatch is too small for a glyph to read as anything but dirt: the
 * 8px band and the 9px dot in a chip. The rainbow says it on its own there.
